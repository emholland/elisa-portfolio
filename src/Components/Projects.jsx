    title: "AI Story Builder System",
    date: "2025 â€“ Present",
    description: `**A collaborative storytelling platform powered by AI agents and user-driven prompts**

The **AI Story Builder** is a full-stack web application that enables users to co-create interactive stories with simulated AI agents. Built with **React**, **Node.js**, and the **OpenAI API**, the platform dynamically generates story chapters through agent collaboration, where each AI persona contributes and votes on the best continuation.

I designed the architecture to support dynamic, turn-based logic and implemented a modular voting system to allow narrative refinement over time. The system uses **Firebase** for real-time data handling and is deployed via **Docker** for cross-environment consistency.

To guide development, I created **UML diagrams** (class, sequence, and use case) to map out interactions. I also led **agile sprints** using **Jira**, coordinating collaboration between design, development, and QA.

I added analytics to evaluate agent behavior and user engagement, using insights to improve both technical quality and user experience.

    title: "Startup Failure Prediction Model",
    date: "Spring 2025",
    description: `**A data-driven machine learning model for identifying high-risk startups**

- Built and presented a logistic regression classifier to predict startup failure using real-world startup data.
- Achieved **99.7% accuracy** and an **AUC score of 0.99**.
- Communicated results in business terms, identifying critical success factors like **industry**, **location**, and **team structure**.
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data, performed **feature engineering**, and optimized models using **GridSearchCV**.
- Bridged the gap between machine learning outputs and strategic business insights in a final report and live presentation.

    title: "Mafia Multiplayer Game",
    date: "Fall 2024",
    description:
      `**A real-time multiplayer strategy game implemented with React Native and WebSocket**

This project is a mobile-friendly, turn-based Mafia game that allows multiple players to join and interact in real time. Built with **React Native**, the app uses **WebSocket** connections to synchronize game state, chat, voting rounds, and role actions across all users.

I led architectural planning by creating detailed **UML diagrams** (class and sequence) to model gameplay logic, network communication, and game state transitions. The server logic included role assignment (e.g., Mafia, Villager), day/night cycle handling, and a real-time voting system, ensuring a smooth interactive experience.

Team collaboration was managed through **Jira**, with version control using **GitHub Projects**. I contributed to the system design, backend socket logic, and mobile interface implementation while coordinating across feature branches.

The final product simulates the Mafia party game in a digital environment, providing an engaging, stateful multiplayer experience with minimal latency.

    title: "Restaurant Review Website",
    date: "Spring 2024",
    description:
      `**A full-stack restaurant review platform with user authentication and dynamic content**

This project is a fully functional review platform where users can create accounts, log in, and leave feedback on local restaurants. Built with a **React** frontend and a **Spring Boot** backend, the app features **role-based authentication**, **RESTful APIs**, and **MySQL** for persistent data storage.

I implemented user registration and login with secure password handling, and connected the front and backend via API routes for review creation, editing, and retrieval. The UI includes real-time updates and conditional rendering based on user roles (e.g., admin vs regular user).

Deployed on **Tomcat**, the site demonstrates core principles of **MVC architecture**, database relationships, and full-stack integration.
